Project is divided into 2 parts right now: Front-end and Back-end.

To add an UI component:
1. Go to frontend project.
2. Go to src/components folder.
3. Create component.

To add a backend API:
1. Go to backend project.
2. Go to src/controller folder.
3. Open api.ts file.
4. Create api.
5. Open src/app.ts.
6. Add API usage in the form app.*method*(*API end point*, api.*api function*).

Build and run:
1. Have 2 terminals open, 1 navigate to backend folder, 1 to front end folder.
2. For backend, do "npm run build" and fix any error.
3. For backend, do "npm start" to start server.
(I'll look into hotloading code for backend as well)

4. For front end, do "npm start" and start live editing code.
